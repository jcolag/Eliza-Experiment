# Eliza-Experiment
A brief experiment to re-create the classic Eliza program using Eve

[Eve](http://witheve.com/) is a development system that revolves around rule-based programming, database as the exclusive data store, literate programming, and transparency.  It presumably has a long way to go before it's ready for prime time, but it seems to have enough potential to be worth some experimentation.

As a simple example that should exercise most of the important features to see how well it might apply to "real" applications, I've chosen [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), a classical artificial intelligence experiment that parodied "the responses of a non-directional psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview" and demonstrate the superficiality of communications with computers.
